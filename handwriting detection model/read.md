Two models are present in the files "best_val_loss_model.h5" and "best_loss_model.h5", which will be used for detecting the handwritten characters. A basic user interface is also created with python to use these models.
A  basic canvas will be provided:
  on pressing 'e' : canavas contents will be erased
  on pressing 'd' : drawing can be done on the canvas
  on pressing 'c' : crop out the letter you want to detect and leave your mouse for evaluation
